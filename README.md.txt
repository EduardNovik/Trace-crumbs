Hi, I'm Eduard, and welcome to Trace Crumbs!

Here, you can find basic information and inspiring pictures about every country in the world. Whether you're planning your next trip or simply curious about different cultures, I've got you covered.

My website features a page for each country, with a brief overview of its geography, population, language, and currency.

But that's not all – I know that pictures can say more than a thousand words, so I've also included a gallery of stunning photos that showcase the beauty and diversity of each country. From towering mountains to pristine beaches, from bustling cities to quaint villages, you'll get a glimpse of what makes each place unique and special.

And here's the best part: you can create your own list of your favorite countries that you want to visit! Simply click the "Add to Favorites" button on each country page, and you'll be able to keep track of all the places you're dreaming of exploring.

I'm constantly working to improve Trace Crumbs – soon, I'll be adding an API that shows public transport information for each country, so you can easily plan your route and get around like a local.

So what are you waiting for? Explore the world with Trace Crumbs and start creating your ultimate travel bucket list!
